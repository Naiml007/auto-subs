# AutoSubs V1 (Legacy Version)
If your OS isn’t supported by **AutoSubs V2**, you can try **AutoSubs V1** using manual installation. However, this requires basic experience with Python and the terminal, and this version is no longer supported so any errors you will have to fix yourself.
>[!Warning]
If using the free version, you must be on Resolve 19.0.3 or earlier, as Blackmagic removed the built-in UI manager in v19.1.
